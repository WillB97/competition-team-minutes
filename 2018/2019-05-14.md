## Minutes
1. Tyler is still waiting on several receipts, including StageSoc, pizza, and Kickstart van hire. Andy BS will chase up volunteer bank details if not provided, and forward Diane's email detailing scaffolding payment to Tyler. The total spend for the competition cycle should be under 10k.
2. The Trustees have suggested a date of 6th June for disbandment. We need to consider having interim people to answer email queries etc.
3. There are still a mix of full and partial kits that have not been returned past the dealine. Jake will chase this up. It would be useful to have another kit day, and there appear to be missing power boards, along with the box of Smallpeice things.
