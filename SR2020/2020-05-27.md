## Topics
 
### Cancelling the 2020 physical competition

- Is there anything outstanding? No

### What we need to do to enable Virtual Comp

- Announcement to teams
	- This is still pending
	- We should aim to include the date of the first competition weekend
		- Currently aiming for this to be the first weekend in July
	- Not sure we need to include the full competition details now, but should decide those soon and definitely well before the first weekend
- Current status:
	- Simulation now essentially working
	- There are some known issues which block the announcement, though we’re reasonably confident they’re fixable
- Structure of the competition
	- How do we achieve the combination of live interactivity we want from the feed, allowing competitors updating their code as they go, while also having certainty around the simulation working reliably? (Bear in mind we’re running untrusted code, so it needs sandboxing and we also don’t want it to be able to mess up the simulation)
	- Do we split the sections on the weekends into morning & afternoon rounds to enable editing between?
- Camera views
	- Work on this is in progress
	- We can definitely have a top-down view plus the camera from the robots, so lets assume we’re going with that for now
- We’re going to need to audit the rulebook, to remove things which don’t make sense for a simulated competition

### Sharing the simulator with volunteers

- Had planned to do this today, but haven’t yet managed to do so
- Might be interesting to organise a volunteers competition a few weeks ahead of the teams’ competition, both to validate the simulator and for our own enjoyment
	- Let’s aim to do this on the weekend before the first weekend the teams are competing
