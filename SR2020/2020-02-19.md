 * Jake will be bringing some tokens

### Venue (<https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/204>)

 * The visit last Saturday was very useful
 * We met one of their tech people, was great to talk to
 * We’ve got a much clearer idea of the layout and our own setup
 * The hire cost might be going to go up:
     * They might need to hire in some tables (has already has budget signoff)
     * They might need to do more advanced power distribution for the pits (Andy BS to check)
 * We probably need to start assigning topic areas to people (Andy BS to do, some are already assigned)
 * We have increased the number of hotel rooms to match the volunteer availability
     * Andy to bump the booking a bit more to match the number we’re hoping to get

### Competition Volunteer Signup Deadline

 * We have set a deadline (14th March) for signups after which we can’t guarantee accommodation
 * We should send a reminder email to volunteers, with updates & photos of the venue
    * Check with the kit team to see if they want to send anything out too
 * Andy BS to send email

## Action Points

### Specific

 * Andy BS: check budget allocation around power distribution to see if we have capacity for hire increase
 * Andy BS: collate existing assigned areas of responsibility for the competition, identify unassigned areas
 * Andy BS: increase quantity of volunteer hotel booking for Saturday evening
 * Andy BS: send email to volunteers with updates and competition signup reminder & deadline
