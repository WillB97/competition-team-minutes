## Topics

### Kit Shipping

 * We have now sent out 5 or 6 kits to teams. This is all bar one of the disclaimer forms that we have received.
 * Shipping to MAI (in Germany) is being investigated
 * The kits which Jake had have now been given to Diane
   * Not clear which part codes these are

### Mentoring update

 * No update here
 * Would it make sense to have someone else pick this up?
 * No, we believe that the current slow progress is ok _for now_
 * This will need to be done before the New Year though

### Venue

 * We have decided that we’re going with Reading
 * Diane has contacted Reading to pay the deposit, that’s being handled
 * We are now in a position to announce this to teams and volunteers (editors note: this happened)
 * We have resolved the concerns we had around transport and accommodation within Reading

### Budget

 * Andy has prepared a draft budget for Reading (which Diane has seen)
 * Accommodation and Venue are the major factors
 * We are very much more constrained on budget this year compared to last year
 * We should review this to ensure that everything is accounted for and to see where we think we can make savings

### Hotels

 * We believe we can book for the hotel on campus, the price so far seems comparable to other hotels, though it has the benefit that everyone would be in one place and already on campus
 * Jake to work out the number of volunteers we expect to have at the competition, in order to make a provisional booking
   * (editors note: Andy ended up doing this)

### 2020 Tech Days

 * London days have been announced
 * SRO: haven’t heard back, will chase again
 * Cambridge: no update

### Chasing silent teams

 * There are 4 teams who we have not heard back from since before Kickstart -- they’ve not even returned their kit disclaimers
 * We should chase these teams (<https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/pull/35>)
