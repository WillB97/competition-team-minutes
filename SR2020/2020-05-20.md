## Topics
 
### Cancelling the 2020 physical competition
 
 - Two main tests proposed before:
	- Test 1: Teams would need enough time to come together to work on their robot in advance of the competition
		- Teams can't come together because the gov advice doesn't allow for sixth forms to open again
	- Test 2: We could be able to run a safe competition
		- 500 person competition unfeasible. Even if they would be allowed in 2 months time, it's unlikely they would be willing.
 - Idea to postpone to later this year non-starter
 	- Schools unlikely to open again until 2021
 	- International teams unlikely to be able to book a flight
 - Need to inform teams - accompanied by Virtual Competition announcement

### What we need to do to enable Virtual Comp

 - Announcement to teams
	 - Need to be clear that it's not exactly the same as the physical
 - Current status:
 	- 90% working simulation (vision main problem)
 	- Plan to deploy to teams
 	- Half of documentation
 - Plan for competition format
 	- Give teams a couple of weeks to work on their code
 	- Pre Recorded matches
 	- Livestream with commentary
 	- Run every weekend or two
 	- Scott Manley running a competition in Kerbal Space Program in similar format (Every couple of weeks with changing challenges)
 	- Would be good to have the possibility for teams to evolve their code over the course of the competition like the real competition
 - Points
 	- Cumulative points over the weekends?
 	- Normal SR pattern of leagues then knockouts (with knockouts in a single weekend).  - Perhaps 2 weeks of leagues then finals.
 - Getting code from teams
 	- By default it's a single code file
 	- Have deadline
 	- Define rules e.g. Must be in robot.zip, must have robot.py in root
 	- Have some sort of form to submit the code (e.g. google form) which can validate the file
 - Livestream
 	- Minimum number of people to make it work
 	- Look at options for services (e.g. where you donï¿½t need an account to participate in viewing)
 - Dates
 	- Initial email: late this week with elevator pitch
 	- Announcement i.e. Virtual Kickstart - Monday 25th May
 		- Details on website
 		- Documentation
 		- Email with details
 		- Mentoring (2 volunteers or teacher on video call because child protection)
 		- Application to virtual competition
 	- Competition team meeting to narrow down logistics - Wednesday 27th May
 	- Dry run with volunteers - late May
 	- Competition - early July
 
### What we need to do with the kits
 
 - Need to postpone this discussion until we meet with the Kit Team
 - Concerns over the safety of volunteers at a kit collection and cleaning/packing event
 - Will bring this up an the potential upcoming AGM

### What we need to do in preparation for Kickstart

 - Decided not to discuss as we're anticipating an AGM which will cover the next competition cycle

## Action Points

### Specific

- Jake: Write email to teams and volunteers about transistion from physical to virtual competition ([#210](https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/210))
- Jake: Cancel Reading booking (Either before or in sync with the competition cancellation) ([#211](https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/211))
- Antoine: Put teaser video on social media ([#212](https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/212))
- Andy Busse: Ask trustees about kit reclaim and confirm our decision to cancel ([#213](https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/213))
