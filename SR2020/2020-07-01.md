## Topics
 
- Simulator
	- Python process bug
- Volunteer session on the 4th
	- 1PM for general volunteer activities
	- Setup earlier in the day
	- Need to contact volunteers
	- Run a dry run of competition with volunteers as teams
	- Need to specify times
- 12 Teams currently signed up
	- Unlikely that any are splitting into multiple teams
- Competition for teams
	- Child protection
		- As long as chat interaction is public and relevant then child protection should not be an issue
		- Need to be mindful of the interaction between teams themselves as well
		- Interviews could be more tricky. Need to brief all volunteers involved
		- Most volunteers not DBS checked
		- No DBS checking specifically for SR currently in place
		- Would ideally have a teacher or parent present for the welfare of the child
		- Get in touch with Scarzy if you have any questions or run into issues
	- Pre Recorded interviews
		- Should have responsible adult (ideally teacher)
		- Should have verbal confirmation that the responsible adult will stay on the line for the full interview duration
		- If the responsible adult drops out under the below circumstances then terminate the call
			- With no clear intention to return
			- After a couple of minutes of a connection loss
		- Bare minimum is 2 volunteers on the call
		- Videos should be moved onto a central SR system then deleted from any volunteer’s system as soon as possible. Videos of competitors should not be stored on a volunteer’s system without valid reason
		- Need a scanned copy of the media consent form
		- Maybe send teams a list of talking points so they can prepare
	- Volunteer roles
		- Unofficially decided
			- Jake/Alistair commentating/judging
- Code submission
	- Peter has created a prototype
	- Would like to get it in a good state before the weekend
	- MVP would be for teams to place code in the IDE and notify volunteers of project details
- YouTube details
	- Antoine is the only one of us with access to the SR Youtube channel
- Decide prizes
	- Drop robot and team image award but the rest are viable
- Could invite STEM ambassadors to the event
- Could repeat this competition over the summer holiday for a wider reach (i.e. not only our current teams competing)
	- Needs further investigation
		- Contact other related STEM organisations for advice on signups

## Actions

- Andy Busse to draft email to volunteers
	- https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues/601
	- Ask for volunteers for
		- The upcoming competition
		- Team interviews
