## Topics

### Tech day this weekend!

 * Is booked for this weekend
 * Won’t be able to get tokens in time for this one though
 * Not sure whether we have guest accounts, but there is also WiFi Guest
 * We’ve not explicitly said teams should bring laptops, so we should push for guest accounts
   * Check with Antoine about this, apparently Dan T was going to speak to Joyce

### Kit Shipping Update

 * Everyone apart from Guernsey has their kit
 * Still not sure how Guernsey are going to get a kit
   * Jake to ask for an update
 * German team were surprised by the battery delivery -- presumably they were not informed beforehand how that was going to be done!

## Action Points

### Specific

- Jake: ask the Kit Team for an update on kit shipping to the team in Guernsey ([#202](https://github.com/srobo/competition-team-minutes/issues/202))
