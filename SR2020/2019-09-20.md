## Minutes

#### Kickstart

- Northern kickstart looking unlikely
- Cambridge kickstart progressing slowly
  - Uni as a venue looking ok but not 100% confirmed yet
  - If needed we _might_ be able to find another venue
  - Looks like we should try to ask for space of 70ish
  - Not sure if we can get guest logins for Cambridge uni
    - Teams would have to bring laptops
    - Not ideal as a barrier to entry, need to find a source for loaning laptops
  - Hills Road is in Cambridge, they could be a backup location if the uni falls through
- Southampton Venue
  - Could be Uni or IBM
  - We think that Uni of Southampton is the best option. IBM could be great for Tech days
- Kickstart presentation is 90% done

#### Accepting Teams

- Hope reports that the Kit team have said they can support 40 kits
- Need to get this number confirmed from Kit team member
- We should accept the first batch of teams and announce kickstart + the closing date for registration (once numbers confirmed).
  - Any teams that register after announcing kickstart will be accepted if spaces are available
- October 1st should be closing deadline for teams signing up

#### Tech days

- Would be great to get them announced early
- A november techday would be great.
  - A bit more 'teach-y' than previous ones

#### The Game

- We now have a game :tada:
- We need to finalise the rules. Need people to review + someone owning the game
- Jake will own finishing the game rules

#### New Volunteers

- Volunteer Recruitment email needs reviews actioned
- Need some welcome emails to send to people to introduce us and where we work
- We should recruit on social media
  - Hold off until welcome emails are written
- We should copy parts of the volunteer recruitment email to a blog post

#### AOB

- Communication between us and volunteers is pretty sporadic
  - We mentioned bringing back SR(A)WN a while ago. We should actually do this
    - This should be sent to the google groups: srobo-news + srobo
  - We should create a new srobo-announce to (eventually) replace MailChimp
- Could we use social media to try and attract sponsors?
  - Maybe something on LinkedIn, feels more business-y than twitter.
  - Should check with trustees before doing anything
